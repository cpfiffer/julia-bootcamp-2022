    "\n",
    "1. Wrap up your estimates from `ols` in a `DataFrame`. You'll need to add this to your environment with `] add DataFrames` and put `using DataFrames` at the top of your script.\n",
    "2. Try to parallelize your bootstrapping procedure! Could be challenging but I'm happy to help. Useful tools are\n",
    "    - `Threads.@threads for thing in ...`\n",
    "        - Will require the use of a lock (I recommend `SpinLock`)! Reach out to me if you want to see how this works.\n",
    "    - `ThreadsX.map(z -> beta_hat(x, y, rand(1:length(y), m), 1:T)` requires that you run `]add ThreadsX` first and put `using ThreadsX` at the top of your script.\n",
    "3. Modify your code to plot the distribution of bootstrapped beta estimates, using `UnicodePlots.density` or `Plots.density`. Could be more interesting if you change the error distribution to something more interesting, like `exp.(randn(n))`.\n",
    "4. Try implementing the above but with instrumental variables! You will need to modify your underlying data a little to support this.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To do this you'll need to add support for the instrumentation matrix $Z$. Recall that the beta estimator for 2SLS is\n",
